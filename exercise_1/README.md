Exercise 1
==========

# Goal
This exercise teaches you how to create a function with for loop, if statement and variable creation. You will implement an Add method in the `url_set.go` file in this exercise.

# Task
Uncomment one test at a time in `exercise_1/url_set_test.go` and write code in `exercise_1/url_set.go` to satisfy the test. We highly recommend you to only make one test pass at a time.

To run the test:
```
cd exercise_1
go test
```
