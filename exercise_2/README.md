Exercise 2
==========

# Goal
This exercise teaches you how to write a struct. You will refactor the solution of exercise 1 into a struct.

# Task
Implement a struct called `URLSet` in `url_set.go`. The struct will have one method `Add`, you are welcome to copy and modify the code you write in exercise 1.

To run the test:
```

# Note
PLEASE DON'T MODIFY TEST CASES (You can uncomment them and that's the only thing you can do).

There is a solution folder, but don't look at it until you have finished the exercise. You will NOT learn much if don't try to solve it yourself.

Feel free to google solutions when you are stuck.
